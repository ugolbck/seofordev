## üéØ Quick Start

## üîë Premium Features Setup

For keyword research and content brief generation:

1. Sign up at [seofor.dev/dashboard](https://seofor.dev/dashboard/)
2. Generate an API key
3. Enter it when prompted in the application
4. Access premium features from the main menu

## Premium features

These features require a paid plan (monthly subscription, or lifetime one-time purchase). You don't need them to optimize your existing pages (site audit), but **they are great to generate new, relevant content** to improve your app's visibility and rankings online. This is eventually **necessary to drive more organic traffic**, and potential customers to your app.

The sooner you generate interesting, high-value content that people are looking for, the more early traffic you will get.

### Keyword suggestions

A great way to start your SEO journey is to pick a set of keywords that you want to _rank on_. You want to write content that echoes with those keywords.

Optimally, you want to target keywords that a lot of people are looking for (high Volume), but that few websites are already covering (low Difficulty). The Keyword Suggestions tool is here for that.

If you don't know where to start, or if you're looking for easy keywords with high volume, this tool will do that for you.

### Content Brief generation

Once you have targeted a few keywords you want to rank on, you will need to generate content.

An easy way to start is to set up a simple, markdown-based blog on your site, and **create a new article per target keyword**.

The brief generator synergizes with your favorite AI code editors. Since we don't know what web framework you're using, we leave it up to your AI to write and integrate the actual article into your website. **We provide the data and instructions that lead to high ranking on your chosen keyword**, your AI tool does the rest. Don't hesitate to tweak the prompt we give you if you wish a specific tone.

We strongly encourage you to proofread any AI-generated content, as it may make mistakes.

#### How to use

1. Navigate to the `Content Brief Generation` tool.
2. Enter the target keyword and run the generation (this may take up to a minute, you may leave the app and check your content brief history later).
3. We analyze your competitors and many other data points, in order to generate a content brief that is tailored for your audience and optimized to compete with Google's top results.
4. Press `e` on the results page to export the content brief to your clipboard.
5. Paste the content brief prompt into your favorite AI code editor (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) and let the magic happen.
6. Once you've pushed your new content online, we recommend you log in to your Google Search Console, and ask Google to index your new page URL. This should speed up the indexation process.
