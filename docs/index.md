# Welcome to seofor.dev Documentation

seofor.dev is a powerful CLI-first SEO tool designed to help indiehackers audit their localhost applications and improve their search engine rankings from day 1.

## What is seofor.dev?

seofor.dev is a command-line interface tool that provides comprehensive SEO analysis and recommendations for web applications. Whether you're building a new project or optimizing an existing one, seofor.dev helps you identify and fix SEO issues before they impact your search rankings. It also helps you identify relevant keywords you should leverage in your application, and automates content creation based on these keywords.

It is a framework-agnostic tool, that means that it works with **any** web framework (NextJS, Vue, Svelte, Django, Laravel, etc).

seofor.dev synergizes with AI code editors such as Claude Code or Cursor: after auditing your localhost server, pressing "__e__" copies a AI-ready prompt that contains all the necessary information to optimize your app for search engines. Dump the prompt in your favorite AI helper, and let it do its job. The same goes for content briefs _(coming soon)_: seofor.dev analyzes your app and competitors for a given keyword you want to rank on, and copies an AI-ready prompt to your clipboard with "__e__". Dump it into your AI helper, which will write ranking content for you.
