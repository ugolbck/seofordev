# Welcome to seofor.dev Documentation

seofor.dev is a powerful CLI-first SEO tool designed to help indiehackers audit their localhost applications and improve their search engine rankings from day 1.

## What is seofor.dev?

seofor.dev is a command-line interface tool that provides comprehensive SEO analysis and recommendations for web applications. Whether you're building a new project or optimizing an existing one, seofor.dev helps you identify and fix SEO issues before they impact your search rankings.

It is a framework-agnostic tool, that means that it works with **any** web framework (NextJS, Vue, Svelte, Django, Laravel, etc).

seofor.dev synergizes with AI code editors such as Claude Code or Cursor: after auditing your localhost server, pressing "__e__" copies an AI-ready prompt that contains all the necessary information to optimize your app for search engines. Dump the prompt in your favorite AI helper, and let it do its job.
